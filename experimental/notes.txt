nclusters = 3
input = str1, str2, str3, ..., strN


* initial guess = [str1, str2, str3]
* assign each input string to one of the cluster based on proximity to the centers.
* recompute the guess -
  . find the top 10% common words in each clusters = [str1, str2, str3]
  . update guesses.
  . repeat until stable clusters are formed.
  . not sure if this will converge. hence limit the max iterations to a reasonable number.
